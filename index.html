                            <p>William and Sapphire's wedding will take place on the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                                November 2024.</p><br></br>
                            <p>The Moat is a Kent farmhouse with a beautiful 14<sup>th</sup> century barn in the
                                village of
                                Wrotham, which sits along Pilgrim’s Way and along the edge of the North Downs.
                                We love the low beams, Tudor panelling, and open fires – a perfect cosy winter
                                pub environment! <br></br> For our
                                wedding, we have exclusive access to the barn, attached bar, and a small private
                                garden. The rest of
                                the pub and the main garden will remain open to members of the public, and dogs
                                are welcome in those
                                areas – but not in the wedding! The garden has space heaters, and there are
                                outdoor nooks available for
                                anyone needing a quiet moment. Parking is free, although you will have to enter
                                your registration at the
                                door.</p>

                                whiskey tasting, coding, and cooking. He has been known to go over-the-top with
                                event planning, as anyone who attended his 29th birthday will remember. </p>

                            <p>Will and Sapph first met by chance when he was celebrating his birthday at
                                Sapph’s
                                favourite pub. They didn’t expect to see each other again but were both
                                delighted to
                                keep on running into each other – until they agreed to meet on purpose.</p>
                            <br />
                            <p>During the first months of their relationship, they played board games, went on
                                hikes in the beautiful Surrey Downs, and spent plenty of time at the pub. Six
                                months
                                later they moved in together during lockdown. Will taught Sapph how to play

                                games, and she taught him more about quantum physics than he wanted to know. <br />
                                Luckily, this brought them closer together.<br /></p>

                            When they moved to Cambridge in 2022, Will decided the time had come to propose. He
                            stayed with Sapph’s parents under the guise of having a study break and, while
                            there, talked with Sapph’s mum about designing a ring with specially chosen stones.
                            He proposed on their first Christmas together in Cambridge. Sapph was thrilled to
                            say yes, although this was before she appreciated how much work planning a wedding would entail.
                        </br>
                            These days, they are kept busy by two cats, attending festivals and gigs, improving
                            their chess and squash games, and exploring the pubs of Cambridge.

                            <p>While our dress code is semi-formal, what we really want is for you to wear something

                                makes you feel confident and ready to party. Don’t feel obliged to shop – we’d love
                                it if you wear
                                something you already own. Dressing to theme is not required, but for those who
                                would like to, our
                                colours are deep green and gold.</p>
